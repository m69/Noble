##A Noble client for a noble-server

Noble - mobile, is a hybrid app client for its companion, the noble-server. The app provides a quick way to consume the noble-server API and download reports on the go. 

It was developed out of neccessity and now serves the greater good. The source has been published as a learning resource and perhaps a community project. Whatever the case, I'll maintain a version in the app stores.

###Frameworks
Let it be known that ***noble*** is made possible by the awesome frameworks Ionic, AngularJS and Cordova. Salud.
